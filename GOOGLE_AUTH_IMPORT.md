# Google Authenticator Import Feature

## Overview

Your app now supports importing 2FA accounts from Google Authenticator's export QR codes! This feature allows users to migrate all their accounts from Google Authenticator in one scan.

## How It Works

### Format Detection

The app now automatically detects two types of QR codes:

1. **Standard TOTP QR codes** (single account):
   ```
   otpauth://totp/Issuer:Account?secret=ABC123&issuer=Issuer
   ```

2. **Google Authenticator Migration QR codes** (multiple accounts):
   ```
   otpauth-migration://offline?data=<ENCODED_DATA>
   ```

### Technical Implementation

The migration QR code contains:
- **URL-encoded** ‚Üí **Base64-encoded** ‚Üí **Protocol Buffers** serialized data
- Multiple accounts with metadata (issuer, account name, algorithm, digits, type)
- Batch information (version, batch size, batch ID)

## Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Detection**: Scans both single-account and multi-account QR codes  
‚úÖ **Batch Import**: Import multiple accounts from one QR code scan  
‚úÖ **Selective Import**: Choose which accounts to import via a modal UI  
‚úÖ **Full Metadata Support**: Preserves algorithm (SHA1/SHA256/SHA512/MD5), digits (6/8), and type (TOTP/HOTP)  
‚úÖ **Secure Storage**: All secrets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage  
‚úÖ **Protocol Buffers Parsing**: Uses `protobufjs` to decode Google's proprietary format

## User Flow

### Single Account Import (Existing)
1. Click "Add Account"
2. Click camera icon to scan QR code
3. Scan a standard `otpauth://totp/` QR code
4. Account details auto-fill
5. Submit to add account

### Multi-Account Import (NEW!)
1. Click "Add Account"
2. Click camera icon to scan QR code
3. Scan a Google Authenticator export QR code (`otpauth-migration://`)
4. **New Modal Opens** showing all detected accounts
5. Select which accounts to import (or select all)
6. Click "Import X Accounts"
7. All selected accounts are encrypted and stored

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `lib/googleAuthMigration.ts` - Parser for Google Authenticator migration format
- `components/MigrationImport.tsx` - UI component for multi-account import modal

### Modified Files
- `lib/qrScanner.ts` - Added migration format detection
- `app/page.tsx` - Added batch import handler and modal integration
- `package.json` - Added `protobufjs` dependency

## Testing

### Test with Real Google Authenticator Export

1. Open Google Authenticator app
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Transfer accounts ‚Üí Export accounts
3. Select accounts to export
4. Generate QR code
5. Scan it with your app's camera
6. You should see the migration import modal!

### Test with Sample Data

For testing purposes, you can generate test migration QR codes using the Python script from the [otp_export repo](https://github.com/qistoph/otp_export) or create a test QR code programmatically.

## Supported Algorithms & Formats

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| SHA1 | ‚úÖ |
| SHA256 | ‚úÖ |
| SHA512 | ‚úÖ |
| MD5 | ‚úÖ |
| 6-digit codes | ‚úÖ |
| 8-digit codes | ‚úÖ |
| TOTP | ‚úÖ |
| HOTP | ‚ö†Ô∏è Parsed but treated as TOTP in storage |

## Security Notes

- All secrets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- The wallet signature is used as the encryption key
- Only the IPFS CID (hash) is stored on-chain
- The actual encrypted secrets are stored on IPFS
- No secrets are logged or exposed in plaintext

## Example Migration Data Structure

When a Google Authenticator export QR is scanned, the app parses:

```typescript
{
  accounts: [
    {
      secret: "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
      name: "Google:user@example.com",
      issuer: "Google",
      accountName: "user@example.com",
      algorithm: "SHA1",
      digits: 6,
      type: "TOTP"
    },
    {
      secret: "HXDMVJECJJWSRB3H",
      name: "GitHub:username",
      issuer: "GitHub",
      accountName: "username",
      algorithm: "SHA1",
      digits: 6,
      type: "TOTP"
    }
  ],
  metadata: {
    version: 1,
    batchSize: 2,
    batchIndex: 0,
    batchId: 1234567890
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The QR code isn't being recognized**  
A: Make sure the QR code is a Google Authenticator export QR code starting with `otpauth-migration://`. Standard `otpauth://totp/` codes will import as single accounts.

**Q: Some accounts failed to import**  
A: Check the console logs for detailed error messages. The app will attempt to import all valid accounts and skip any that fail parsing.

**Q: Can I import from Authy or other apps?**  
A: This feature specifically supports Google Authenticator's export format. Other apps may use different formats. Standard `otpauth://totp/` QR codes work universally.

**Q: What happens to my existing accounts?**  
A: Imported accounts are added to your existing bundle. No accounts are replaced or deleted during import.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Support for other authenticator app export formats
- Duplicate detection before import
- Logo matching for common services
- Support for HOTP counter preservation
- Batch export feature (reverse migration)

## Dependencies

- `protobufjs` - Protocol Buffers JavaScript implementation for parsing Google's binary format
- `qr-scanner` - QR code scanning (already in use)
- `otpauth` - TOTP/HOTP generation (already in use)
