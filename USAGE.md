   - Paste this into Base Auth
   
   #### For Existing 2FA:
   - You'll need to re-enable 2FA on the service to get the secret again
   - Disable 2FA temporarily
   - Re-enable it and choose manual/text entry option
   - Copy the secret key provided

4. **Save to Blockchain**:

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use a hardware wallet for maximum security
- Keep your wallet seed phrase in a secure, offline location
- Use strong wallet passwords/PINs
- Enable biometric authentication on your wallet app

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Share your wallet private keys or seed phrase
- Store seed phrases digitally (photos, cloud storage, etc.)
- Use the same wallet for high-value transactions if possible
- Access your wallet on public/untrusted devices

### 2FA Secret Management

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep backup copies of your 2FA secrets in a secure location
- Test each account immediately after adding
- Store critical 2FA secrets in multiple secure locations
- Use Base Auth as one part of your security strategy

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Rely solely on Base Auth for 2FA storage
- Add secrets for critical financial accounts without backups
- Share your 2FA secrets with anyone
- Use weak or reused secrets

### Account Recovery

**Important**: If you lose access to your wallet, you will lose access to your 2FA secrets stored in Base Auth.

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. Always maintain independent backups of your 2FA secrets
2. Store recovery codes provided by services when setting up 2FA
3. Consider using multiple 2FA methods for critical accounts

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Organizing Accounts

- Group related accounts with prefixes (e.g., "Work - Slack", "Work - Email")
- Add most-used accounts first for easy access

### Backup Strategy

1. **Primary**: Base Auth on-chain
2. **Secondary**: Encrypted text file on USB drive
3. **Tertiary**: Paper backup in secure physical location
4. **Recovery**: Save all service-provided recovery codes
